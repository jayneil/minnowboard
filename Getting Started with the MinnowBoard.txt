Summary

In this guide, we will examine the various features of the MinnowBoard and boot the Angstrom embedded Linux distribution. This guide is for new users who are just getting started with the MinnowBoard. 



Contents of the box

When you purchase a MinnowBoard, you the following items are included in the box as shown in Figure -1:

1. MinnowBoard

2. 5V Power Adapter

3. 4GB micro SD card preloaded with the Angstrom Linux Distribution (Yocto Project Compatible)

Anatomy of a MinnowBoard

This section outlines the various components on the MinnowBoard. Figure -2 below annotates the important components on the top side of the MinnowBoard.

NOTE TO JAYNEIL: Replace "Expansion Header" with "Expansion Connector"

Figure -3 below annotates the important components on the bottom side of the MinnowBoard.

Preparing the MicroSD Card

Please note that this section is completely optional. The MinnowBoard already comes with a microSD card that is preloaded with a working Angstrom Linux image. In case you want to use a newer image or want to program the microSD card from scratch, this section covers it all. These steps were created using an Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit desktop system.

Note:- This section is for ***L***inux users only. If you are using Windows, please skip ahead to the [sec:Windows-Users] ***section***.

• First download the latest Angstrom Linux image for MinnowBoard using the following link:

http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/minnow/Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.06.04.img.xz

At the time of writing this guide, the latest image available for download was 'Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.06.04.img.xz' 

• Now, identify the correct disk device filename for your microSD card. You can do this by opening the Disk Utility application (sometimes also called Disks) in Ubuntu and clicking on the microSD card entry. See the Device field to determine the raw device name of your microSD card. Note that this device name should specify an entire disk device (e.g, /dev/sde), and not an individual disk partition (e.g, /dev/sde1)

NOTE TO JAYNEIL: Same note about unmounting the filesystems as I pointed out in the LED guide

• Now unpack the image to the microSD card by typing the following commands in a terminal window: 
$ xzcat Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.05.24.img.xz | sudo dcfldd of=/dev/sdc



Here 'sdX' stands for the device id of the microSD card.



Booting Angstrom

• First insert the card into the microSD card slot, label side up as shown in Figure -4. 

 Figure-4: Connecting the micro SD card

• Next, connect an external keyboard and mouse to the MinnowBoard. Then connect ***a*** USB mini cable to your computer and the MinnowBoard as shown in Figure -5. This connection will be used to access the serial console of the MinnowBoard.

 Figure-5: Connecting a USB mini cable for serial console access

• To power up the MinnowBoard, connect the 5V/2.5A power ***supply*** as shown in Figure -6:

 Figure-6: Powering up the MinnowBoard

• Access the MinnowBoard's serial console via a terminal emulator:$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 Note:- You can also use minicom, but screen is much easier to use! Also in most cases the virtual USB serial port is ttyUSB0. If it does not work, try ttyUSB1 .

• You should see a similar Angstrom login screen as shown in Figure - 7. The username is 'root' and there is no password - just press the Enter key.

 Figure-7: Angstrom

• If you have an external display connected to the MinnowBoard via the HDMI port, you should see output similar to that shown below in Figure - 8

Windows Users

This section is for those who are using a Windows machine to interact with the MinnowBoard. 

Serial Terminal

We will be using Teraterm as our terminal application. Please follow the steps below to set up Teraterm:

• Download the latest version of Teraterm using the link below:

http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/releases/

At the time of writing this guide, the latest version of Teraterm was 'teraterm-4.78.exe'

• Install the Teraterm software by double clicking on the exe file downloaded earlier. If it displays a security warning, accept it and click on 'Run' as shown in Figure - 11 below:

 Figure-11: Teraterm installation

• Now just follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. It is advised to do the 'full' installation instead of the 'standard' one as shown in Figure - 12 below:

 Figure-12: Perform Teraterm full installation

• Launch Teraterm. Then go to Setup>Serial port and change the settings as shown in Figure - 13 below:

 Figure-13: Teraterm Serial Port setup

• Then go to File>New connections and select the Serial option and chose the appropriate COM port as shown in Figure - 14 below

 Figure-14: Setting up a new connection

• Then connect the required accessories as described earlier in this guide and power up the MinnowBoard. If all went well, you should see a login screen in Teraterm as shown in Figure - 15 below:

Preparing the microSD card

• First, download the latest Angstrom Linux image using the link below:[   http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/minnow/Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.06.04.img.xz]

• The 7-zip utility is needed to decompress the Angstrom image file you just downloaded. Obtain the 7-zip utility from the link below and install it:http://www.7-zip.org/download.html


• Decompress the previously downloaded Angstrom image using 7-zip as shown in Figure - 16 below. The resulting file should have an extension '.img' .

 Figure-16: Decompressing the image

• Image Writer for Windows is needed to write the .img file to a microSD card. Download and install Image Writer using the link below:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download 

• Insert the mirco SD card into your desktop computer using an appropriate microSD card adapter. Next, launch the Image Writer software we just installed earlier. Select the Angstrom image file and write it to the microSD card as shown in Figure - 17 below.

Now you can continue with the Booting Angstrom section using your newly flashed microSD card.
