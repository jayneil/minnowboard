Preparing the MicroSD Card

Please note that this section is completely optional. The MinnowBoard already comes with a microSD card that is preloaded with a working Angstrom Linux image. In case you to use a newer image or want to program the microSD card from scratch, this section covers it all. These steps were created using an Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit system.

Note:- This section is for linux users only. If you are using Windows, please skip ahead to the [sec:Windows-Users] section.

• First download the latest Angstrom Linux image for MinnowBoard from the link below:

http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/minnow/Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.05.24.img.xz

At the time of writing this guide, the latest image available for download was 'Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.05.24.img.xz' 

• Now, identify the correct raw device name (like /dev/sde - not /dev/sde1) for your microSD card. You can do this by opening the Disk Utility application (sometimes also called Disks) in Ubuntu and clicking on the microSD card entry. See the Device field to determine the raw device name of your microSD card.

NOTE TO JAYNEIL: Add filesystem unmounting instructions here

• Now unpack the image to the microSD card by typing the following commands in a terminal window: 

$ xzcat Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.05.24.img.xz | sudo dcfldd of=/dev/sdc

Here 'sdX' stands for the device id of the microSD card.



GPIO on the MinnowBoard

The MinnowBoard provides a variety of GPIO(General Purpose Input Output), some with a dedicated purpose. For the purpose of this guide, I will be concentrating only on GPIO(s) which are on the J9 expansion header as shown in Figure - 4 . Please refer the table below to find out how are the GPIO(s) actually referenced in the kernel and their default modes as well as values. Unless otherwise stated the GPIO(s) on J9 expansion header are rated at 3.3V and can source/sink a maximum of 10mA. Also, it can be seen from the table that the GPIO(s) are by default set to be used in INPUT mode and have PULL-UP resistors enabled.

 Figure-4: GPIO on the MinnowBoard

As you can see from Figure -4, there are a total of ten pins on the J9 header out of which 8 pins can be used as GPIO. The remaining two pins are GND and 3.3V as mentioned in the table. 

The GPIO(s) are accessible via the user space in Linux at the location below on the filesystem:

/sys/class/gpio

There is one directory per GPIO, named as shown below(as an example only two GPIO(s) are shown here): 

/sys/class/gpio/gpio245

Inside each one of those directories, there are files named "direction” and “value” as shown in Figure - 5. The former is for configuring the mode of GPIO as input(“in”) or output(“out”) while the latter is for the value('1' for HIGH and '0' for LOW) if used in output mode. 

 Figure-5: GPIO attributes



Selecting the correct LED

• To make sure that you do not damage the GPIO pins on the MinnowBoard, please use a LED whose rating should not exceed 3.3V/10mA:

http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/HLMP-4700-C0002/516-2483- 2-ND/1234840

• If you have an LED that is higher than the above mentioned ratings, please refer the refer the link below to select an appropriate current limiting resistor:

Extra Credit

This is an optional section which you can read for further understanding. In a nutshell, we are trying to access the on board GPIO(s) via the userspacehttp://elinux.org/images/4/4f/02-linux-quick-start.pdf in Linux. To be more precise we are trying to use the sysfshttp://www.makelinux.net/books/lkd2/ch17lev1sec8 interface. sysfs is a virtual filesystem which enumerates the devices and busses attached to the system(board in our case) into a file system hierarchy that can be accessed from userspace. It's generated by the kernel and always mounted at /sys. The GPIO sysfs interface allows users to manipulate any GPIO from userspace. Since it uses [http://elk.informatik.fh-augsburg.de/rtlabor/gnublin-lpc3131/work_eplpc3131/Dokumente/005_gpio.pdf||gpiolib], it is able to dynamically utilize all GPIOs on the system. The preloaded Angstrom image on the MinnowBoard already has all the GPIO on J9 header exported to the userspace by default.



Setup

Please refer the Figure - 6 below to see the connections:

 Figure-6: Connection Diagram

Only the pins on the J9 expansion header are used in this case. Connect the anode of the LED to the resistor(I am using a 330 ohms resistor) which in turn is connected to pin 3(GPIO) and connect the cathode of the LED to pin 2(GND) . You can purchase the male-female type hookup/jumper wires used for connections from the link below:

Booting Angstrom

• First insert the card into the microSD card slot label side up as shown in Figure -7. 

 Figure-7: Connecting the microSD card

• Next, connect an external keyboard and mouse to the MinnowBoard. Then connect a USB mini cable to your computer and the MinnowBoard as shown in Figure -8. This connection will be used to access the serial console of the MinnowBoard.

 Figure-8: Connecting a USB mini cable for serial console access

• To power up the MinnowBoard, connect the 5V/3A power supply as shown in Figure -9:

NOTE TO JAYNEIL: Confirm power supply amperage

 Figure-9: Powering up the MinnowBoard

• Access the MinnowBoard's serial console via a terminal emulator:$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200Note:- You can also use minicom, but screen is much easier to use! Also in most cases the virtual USB serial port is ttyUSB0. If it does not work, try ttyUSB1.

• You should see a similar Angstrom login screen as shown in Figure - 10. The username is 'root' and there is no password - just press the Enter key.

 Figure-10: Angstrom



Steps

• Now let us toggle that LED!

GPIO - 3 is referenced as 244 in the kernel. Since, it is set to be used in INPUT mode by default, we need to change its mode to OUTPUT. Write the following command in your terminal to accomplish it:

echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio244/direction

Now we are ready to toggle the LED. Write the following commands in your terminal as shown in Figure - 11(First one is for turning ON and latter for OFF):

echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio244/value

 Figure-11: Toggle the LED

You should get an output as shown below:

 Figure-12: Led ON

 Figure-13: LED OFF



Windows Users

This section is for those who are using a Windows machine to interact with the MinnowBoard. 

Serial Terminal

We will be using Teraterm as our terminal application. Please follow the steps below to set up Teraterm:

• Download the latest version of Teraterm from the link below:

http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/releases/

At the time of writing this guide the latest version was 'teraterm-4.78.exe'

• Install the Teraterm software by double clicking on the exe file downloaded earlier. If it displays a security warning, accept it and click on 'Run' as shown in Figure - 14 below:

 Figure-14: Teraterm installation

• Now just follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. It is advised to do the 'full' installation instead of the 'standard' one as shown in Figure - 15 below:

 Figure-15: Perform Teraterm full installation

• Launch Teraterm. Then go to Setup>Serial port and change the settings as shown in Figure - 16 below:

 Figure-16: Teraterm Serial Port setup

• Then go to File>New connections and select the Serial option and chose the appropriate COM port as shown in Figure - 17 below

 Figure-17: Setting up a new connection

• Then connect the required accessories as described earlier in the guide and power up the MinnowBoard. If all went well, you should see a successful output in Teraterm as shown in Figure - 18 below:

Preparing the microSD card

• First, download the latest Angstrom Linux image from the link below:

http://dominion.thruhere.net/koen/angstrom/minnow/Angstrom-development-GNOME-image-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-minnow-2013.06.04.img.xz

• Next, download the 7-zip utility from the link below and install it:

http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

• Decompress the previously downloaded Angstrom image using 7-zip as shown in Figure - 19 below. The resulting file should have an extension '.img' .

 Figure-19: Decompressing the image

• Now, install 'Image Writer for Windows' software from the link below:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download 

• Insert the microSD card into the computer using an appropriate adapter. Next, launch the image writer software we just installed earlier. Select the Angstrom image and write it to the microSD card as shown in Figure - 20 below.
